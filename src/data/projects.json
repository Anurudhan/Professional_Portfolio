Admin manages instructors by reviewing their resumes and details before granting access, oversees all users, controls site banners, and organizes course categories such as Electronics, Web Development, and Mathematics. Instructors have a dashboard to create and manage lessons with videos, set up and manage assessments, track student progress, and interact with students through a real-time chat feature. Students can browse free and paid courses, purchase courses, view their marks and learning journey, and receive certificates upon course completion. The platform is designed for performance, scalability, and interactive learning, deployed using Docker and Kubernetes.",
